During this program students choose a project and are then given the resources and the help to be able to build this project. Videos of the project in action can be seen [here](http://www.bluestampengineering.com/author/sfishman/).\r\n\r\n### The Code\r\nThe code for the Stopduino runs on Arduino 1.0.1\r\n\r\n### The Design\r\nInitially the original design I made was to hard to make with the limited resources I have. If you were to have sheet metal and some way to bend it properly and weld it together that would be ideal. Unfortunately I didn't have that so I made do with pvc pipe.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems while making the Stopduino feel free to email me at sfishman96@gmail.com with questions","google":""}
