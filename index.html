          <h3>Stopduino</h3>

<p>The stopduino is an Arduino based project based off of this <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-stoplight-web-server/">instructable</a>. </p>

<h3>What is the Stopduino?</h3>

<p>The Stopduino is a stoplight made by myself in which the lights (also made by me) are controlled over an Arduino Ethernet which is then controlled over the internet. </p>

<h3>What was this for?</h3>

<p>I made this project during my time at the BlueStamp Engineering program. During this program students choose a project and are then given the resources and the help to be able to build this project. Videos of the project in action can be seen <a href="http://www.bluestampengineering.com/author/sfishman/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>The code for the Stopduino runs on Arduino 1.0.1</p>

<h3>The Design</h3>

<p>Initially the original design I made was to hard to make with the limited resources I have. If you were to have sheet metal and some way to bend it properly and weld it together that would be ideal. Unfortunately I didn't have that so I made do with pvc pipe.</p>

<p>If you have any problems while making the Stopduino feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:sfishman96@gmail.com">sfishman96@gmail.com</a> with questions</p>
